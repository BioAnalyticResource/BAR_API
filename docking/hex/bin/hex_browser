#
#  hex_browser: 
#
#  This is a wrapper program to execute Hex with a single PDB file, which
#  is assumed to be passed as $1 ... this is primarily for use as a PDB viewer
#  application for web browsers. Just edit your ~/.mailcap file (or use 
#  Netscape's edit/preferences directly) to cause this script to be invoked
#  when a PDB file is retrieved. 
#
#  For example, to use hex instead of rasmol as your PDB viewer, add/edit 
#  these lines in your ~/.mailcap file:
#
#                     application/x-rasmol; hex_browser %s
#                     chemical/x-ras; hex_browser %s
#                     chemical/x-pdb; hex_browser %s
#
#  and ensure that $HEX_ROOT/bin is in your $PATH, as usual.
#
#  This is a bit of a hack, since most PDB servers know about rasmol, but
#  don't know about Hex. Note that Hex always starts its display in its 
#  default style (possibly modified by the HEX_STARTUP file), ignoring any 
#  rasmol commands which might be embedded in the PDB file.
#
#  NB. the -browse option is not implemented in Hex version 2.1 and earlier.
#  Attempting to use Hex in browser mode with version 2.1 will promptly fail.
#  Browser mode works on SGI and SUN, but may fail with a SIGSEGV under Linux 
#  (seems to be a bug in the Mesa 3.x graphics widget).
#
#  NB. this script exists mainly to document "browser mode": its possible to 
#  invoke "hex -browse" directly from the web browser, as described above,
#  but its also useful (?) to capture the usual stdout messages in a terminal
#  window for the duration of the program.
