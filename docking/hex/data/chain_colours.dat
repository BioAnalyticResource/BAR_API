#  -----------------
#
#  This file gives the mapping between PDB chain names and chain colours which
#  is used when molecules are coloured by chain id.
#
#  Molecules can be coloured using more detailed colour selection commands
#  (see the files in $HEX_ROOT/colours), but its also convenient to have a
#  more global default colouring scheme which is always valid whenever a new
#  molecule is loaded.
#
#  Format:  Chain-name Chain-colour
