Hex is an interactive molecular superposition and rigid-body docking program 
for use with "large" molecules such as protein domains and DNA fragments. Hex 
can read (and write) PDB and SDF coordinate files. Hex will run on most 
Windows-XP/Windows-7 and Linux PCs, and on recent Mac PowerBooks.

This version (07 April 2013) provides highly parallelised (CPU multi-threaded) 
and GPU-accelerated (using CUDA on Nvidia graphics cards) docking calculations.

For Windows, download and double-click the self-installer:

   hex-8.0.0-win.exe              (Windows without CUDA)
   hex-8.0.0-win-cuda.exe         (Windows with CUDA)

For 64-bit Linux versions, you will need to download a self-installer file:

   hex-8.0.0-x64-mint14.run        (Intel Linux 64-bit without CUDA)
   hex-8.0.0-x64-mint14-cuda50.run (Intel Linux 64-bit with CUDA)
   hex-8.0.0-x64-mint14-nogui.run  (Intel Linux 64-bit no graphics)

Similarly, 32-bit Linux, select one of these:

   hex-8.0.0-x32-mint14.run        (Intel Linux 32-bit without CUDA)
   hex-8.0.0-x32-mint14-cuda50.run (Intel Linux 32-bit with CUDA)
   hex-8.0.0-x32-mint14-nogui.run  (Intel Linux 32-bit no graphics)

For Intel Mac, it is similar:

   hex-8.0.0-x64-osx-10.8.run      (Intel Mac, OS X, 64-bit)
   hex-8.0.0-x32-osx-10.6.run      (Intel Mac, OS X, 32-bit)

Pick the one that most closely matches your own or version of Linux
(normally, the 32-bit binaries should run on 64-bit machines) Then just 
run the self-installer:

   sh hex-8.0.0-x64-mint14.run

The install script is intended to simplify the installation process, and can 
normally be trusted to install Hex correctly, even if you have already 
installed an earlier version of the program. The script will add any 
necessary environment variables to your default shell environment. In cases 
where a central file server is used to serve files to different types of 
workstations, several different executables may be installed into a single 
hex installation directory. It is also safe to install version 5 into the 
same directory structure as earlier versions.

If you prefer to install the program manually, you should create a hex 
directory, and then uncompress the distribution files into it. For example, 
assuming you are installing for 32-bit Mint12, use something like:

   sh /hex-8.0.0-x32-mint14.run --noexec

   mv hex-dist-8.0.0/hex-8.0.0-x32.tgz /your-hex-directory

   cd /your-hex-directory
   
   zcat hex-8.0.0-x32.tgz  | tar xvpf -

In order to make Hex work properly, your login script (either .login or 
.profile) should set the environment variable HEX_ROOT to the hex installation
directory. You should also add Hex's bin directory to your PATH so that (a) 
you can run Hex, and (b) Hex can find the files it needs under HEX_ROOT.
These two steps are normally performed by the hex_configure.run script.
Optionally, you can also specify directories that specify where Hex should 
start looking for colour files, macro files, and PDB files, and you can 
specify the location of a temporary cache directory (all except the hex 
installation directories are optional and must be created manually). You can 
also specify the default number of CPUs and GPUs to use on a multi-processor 
system, and request stereo graphics if your hardware supports stereo.

Here's a C-shell example (I have these lines in my ~/.cshrc file)

   setenv HEX_ROOT       /home/dritchie/hex         # required
   setenv HEX_PDB        .
   setenv HEX_MACROS     .
   setenv HEX_COLOUR     .
   setenv HEX_DATA       /home/dritchie/hex_data
   setenv HEX_CACHE      /tmp/dritchie/hex_cache
   setenv HEX_STARTUP    /home/dritchie/hex/examples/startup.mac
   setenv HEX_CPUS       8
   setenv HEX_GPUS       2
   setenv HEX_MESSAGES   yes
   setenv HEX_STEREO     yes
   setenv HEX_CUDA_PATH  /home/dritchie/hex/cuda64-5.0

   setenv PATH           ${PATH}:${HEX_ROOT}/bin    # required

For Bourne and Korn-shell users, the corresponding commands (in ~/.profile)
would be:

   set HEX_ROOT        = /home/dritchie/hex         # required
   set HEX_PDB         = .
   set HEX_MACROS      = .
   set HEX_COLOUR      = .
   set HEX_DATA        = /home/dritchie/hex_data 
   set HEX_CACHE       = /tmp/dritchie/hex_cache
   set HEX_STARTUP     = /home/dritchie/hex/examples/startup_v5.mac
   set HEX_CPUS        = 8
   setenv HEX_GPUS       2
   set HEX_MESSAGES    = yes
   set HEX_STEREO      = yes
   set HEX_CUDA_PATH   = /home/dritchie/hex/cuda64-5.0

   set PATH            = ${PATH}:${HEX_ROOT}/bin    # required

   export PATH HEX_ROOT                             # required
   export HEX_PDB HEX_MACROS HEX_COLOUR HEX_DATA HEX_CACHE 
   export HEX_STARTUP HEX_CPUS

Stereo graphics is only available if you have a suitable graphics card AND 
if you have installed and configured the appropriate drivers. Please see 
the Hex Manual for more details.

In addition to the README, PROBLEMS and LICENCE files, the hex directory 
should contain the following 7 directories:

   bin	exe	doc	data	examples  pipes   cache

If you download the CUDA version you will also get a directory which contains 
the CUDA run-time libraries (currently using CUDA version 5.0):

   cuda64-5.0    cuda-5.0

Typing "hex" at the Unix command prompt should locate the script hex in the 
bin directory which then launches the appropriate executable from the exe 
directory. The exe directory may contain several executables The examples 
directory contains several PDB files and Hex macro files. Unless you set the 
above environment variables, Hex will first look in the examples directory 
for any macro and PDB files you want to use. 

The data directory contains the runtime data files necessary to colour and 
charge protein and DNA molecules, for example. The pipes directory contains 
scripts which allow the molecular structures in the current Hex scene to be 
written directly to external programs such as GRASP or Molscript.

The basic installation includes a Manual and some examples. A more extensive
list of examples is provided in the optional docking_examples.tgz file, which
is available on the main Hex web page. A much more extensive set of docking 
test cases can be obtained from Zhiping Weng's group at: 

   http://zlab.bu.edu/zdock/benchmark.shtml

The largest single repository of 3D protein structures is the Protein Data 
Bank (PDB), hosted by Rutgers University at http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/. 

Installation Problems? Try looking at the PROBLEMS file in $HEX_ROOT.
Please remember that "Hex" is essentially a research program and it is
provided "as is", without any guarantee of updates or user-support.
I will attempt to respond to any problems and I would welcome suggestions 
for future enhancements.
